# Search Engine

We're building a search engine!

Just for fun, to learn about how web crawling, tokenizing, databases, all that works in a real project.

Just to build something cool

Todo:
    [ ] - Frontend
    [ ] - Tokenizers
    [ ] - Scoring
    [ ] - Web crawling
    [ ] - Come up with a name

Cool features to add:
    [ ] - Build a ml model or something else to determine whether a page was generated by AI and exclude or flag that result in the search
    [ ] - Build a dashboard to see how many sotes/pages have been crawled, how much is stored in the database, how many links have been foloowed, etc.
