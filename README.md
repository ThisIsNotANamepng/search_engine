# 🔍 Search Engine

> ⚠️ This project is in a very primative state 🚧

We're building a search engine!

Just for fun, to learn about how web crawling, tokenizing, databases, all that works in a real project.

Just to build something cool

Todo:

- [ ] - Frontend
- [ ] - Tokenizers
- [ ] - Scoring
- [ ] - Web crawling
- [ ] - Come up with a name

Cool features to add:

- [ ] - Build a ml model or something else to determine whether a page was generated by AI and exclude or flag that result in the search
- [ ] - Build a dashboard to see how many sotes/pages have been crawled, how much is stored in the database, how many links have been foloowed, etc.

Indexes to index:

- Kagi list of small blogs (these are rss files, need to parse those) - https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt
